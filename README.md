Some of code from my master thesis
<p> Hello! </p>
<p> Summary of Master thesis </p>
<p>Title: Implementation of choroplethic map evaluation methods in the ArcGIS environment </p>
The main objectives research: The scientific aim of the paper is to test the possibilities of creating a universal tool to support cartographic editing in a GIS program and to test its "efficiency". The technical aim of the work is to create a fully functional tool that will support the creation of choroplethic map.
Scope of research: The creation of a toolbox TableError, calculating the 9 most commonly used cartogram evaluation indexes (TAI, OAI, BAI, MAI, BAIS, D, AG, C, HN).
Methodology of research: Prototyping of a programming tool. Testing performance on data sets of different sizes. Implementation of data processing algorithms by object-oriented programming in Python.
Obtained results: Toolbox TableError calculates selected indexes of the choroplethic map evaluation. In the first field, the layer for which the indexes will be calculated is selected. You can only select a layer that is symbolic of the graduated color. In the next field there is a drop Field parameter, where the indexes are selected. Then select the workspace folder where you want to save and next will delete the work files. In the last field you will indicate the path, where the result file will be saved with the calculated choroplethic map evaluation indexes.
Conclusions: The extensive help with ArcGIS allows you to quickly find the necessary tools and functions and to take full advantage of the software's possibilities. This made it possible to create a TableError toolbox without extensive knowledge of the Python language or the tools provided by ArcGIS.
The TabularError tool can be used by cartographers to select the most suitable choroplethic map to represent the data. By calculating a variety of indexes (which have different substantive and mathematical characteristics), the cartographer will have a better view of the data and the cartogram being produced.
The environment on which the tool is created (ArcGIS) is a commercial software program, so some of the possible users will not be able to use it. Many more people could use the tool if it were based on a GIS program on a free license (e.g. QGIS). </p>
